To host the bot yourself, install the `dotnet` command line tool (.NET 5.0 at a minimum), create a JSON file in the root directory called `config.json` with the contents `{"token": "yourbottokenhere"}`, and run `dotnet run` from the root directory. 

Ping the bot to interact with it. For example, to see a list of commands and example usage: `@soberbot help`
